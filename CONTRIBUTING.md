# Contributing

The Open Source Guides website has a collection of resources for individuals, communities, and companies. These resources help people who want to learn how to run and contribute to open source projects. Contributors and people new to open source alike will find the following guides especially useful:

* [How to Contribute to Open Source](https://opensource.guide/how-to-contribute/)
* [Building Welcoming Communities](https://opensource.guide/building-community/)

## Get involved

There are many ways to contribute to Sveltepress, and many of them do not involve writing any code. Here's a few ideas to get started:

* Simply start using sveltepress. Go through [Quick start](https://sveltepress.site/guide/quick-start/) guide. Does everything work as expected? If not, we're always looking for improvements. Let us know by opening an issue.
* Look through the [open issues](https://github.com/SveltePress/sveltepress/issues). A good starting point would be issues tagged good first issue. Provide workarounds, ask for clarification, or suggest labels. Help triage issues.
* If you find an issue you would like to fix, open a pull request.
* Read through the docs site. If you find anything that is confusing or can be improved, you can make edits by clicking "Suggest changes to this page" at the bottom of the page.

## Bugs

We use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SveltePress/sveltepress/issues) for our public bugs. If you would like to report a problem, take a look around and see if someone already opened an issue about it. If you are certain this is a new unreported bug, you can [submit a bug report](https://github.com/sveltejs/svelte/issues/new/choose).
